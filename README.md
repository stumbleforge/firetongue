## Accessibility Statement

I deliberately chose to use .txt files to:

- **Support screen readers** without formatting conflicts
- **Enable lightweight editing** for custom adaptations
- **Serve as a base** for community-driven accessibility projects

I provide this work **as-is** — a starting point for others to build on. While I won't create derivatives myself, I encourage you to:

- **Convert** to accessible formats
- **Translate** into other languages
- **Modernize** outdated sections (via forks/pull requests)
